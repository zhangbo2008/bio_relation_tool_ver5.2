"# searching_in_trie_in_microseconds_1000wdata_python" 


just a  very simple using of trie Tree. very useful in big data of matching substring with the words in dict. you can assume the solving is a powerful version of kmp in big data.

# pipei have 3 method   pipei means find_substring 
pipei_shortest : if you match the shortest word in dict, after that and you just skip this word and match the else string with the word in dict.


pipei_all: you find all the matching with the word in dict. 
 
pipei_longest:you can find the lognest word in dict , after that  and you just skip this word and match the else string with the word in dict.


i hope you can find the explaning code in the 1.py
